Create a rails 2.1 app using Ruby 1.8.6. No extra gems to be used other than the rails ones. (We use RVM to manage our Ruby installations. It's *very* useful for running different versions of Rails and Ruby on the same machine.)

Create a one page website that asks you to select your language from English, French and German.

The site should remember the users language selection for 7 days.

The page should have a button to enable the user to discard the current language selection and select another.

While a language is selected grab the first 5 products from the following feeds depending on the language and display them.
